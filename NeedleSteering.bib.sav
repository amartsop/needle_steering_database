  abstract = {In this study, a distributed approach to account for dynamic friction during needle insertion in soft tissue is presented. As is well known, friction is a complex nonlinear phenomenon. It appears that classical or static models are unable to capture some of the observations made in systems subjected to significant frictional effects. In needle insertion, translational friction would be a matter of importance when the needle is very flexible, or a stop-and-rotate motion profile at low insertion velocities is implemented, and thus, the system is repeatedly transitioned from a pre-sliding to a sliding mode and vice versa. In order to characterize friction components, a distributed version of the LuGre model in the state-space representation is adopted. This method also facilitates estimating cutting force in an intra-operative manner. To evaluate the performance of the proposed family of friction models, experiments were conducted on homogeneous artificial phantoms and animal tissue. The results illustrate that our approach enables us to represent the main features of friction which is a major force component in needle-tissue interaction during needle-based interventions.},

The force at the fixed end of the needle and the needle deflection were measured using a force sensor and a bi-plane X-ray imaging system, and the model was evaluated with the data. We define a physical quantity w, which we can infinitesimal force per length, analogous to tranction (force per surface area). The model predicts w to be constant over the lenght of the i nserted portion of the needle. However the results indicate that this assumption does not fully accout for the real deflection. It is strongly suggested that there is an additional degree of freedom: a moment or a rotational force acting on the needle.},

  abstract = {The tip asymmetry of a bevel-tip needle results in the needle naturally bending when it is inserted into soft tissue. This enables robotic needle steering, which can be used in medical procedures to reach subsurface targets inaccessible by straight-line trajectories. However, accurate path planning and control of needle steering requires models of needle-tissue interaction. Previous kinematic models required empirical observations of each needle and tissue combination in order to fit model parameters. This study describes a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, which can be used to predict needle behavior and optimize system design based on fundamental mechanical and geometrical properties of the needle and tissue. We first present an analytical model for the loads developed at the tip, based on the geometry of the bevel edge and material properties of soft-tissue simulants (gels). We then present a mechanics-based model that calculates the deflection of a bevel-tipped needle inserted through a soft elastic medium. The model design is guided by microscopic observations of needle-gel interactions. The energy-based formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters, and the geometry and material properties of the needle. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in experimental studies of robotic needle insertion.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present needle insertion forces and motion trajectories measured during actual brachytherapy needle insertion while implanting radioactive seeds in the prostate glands of 20 different patients. The needle motion was captured using ultrasound images and a 6 degree-of-freedom electromagnetic-based position sensor. Needle velocity was computed from the position information and the corresponding time stamps. From in vivo data we found the maximum needle insertion forces to be about 15.6 and for and needles, respectively. Part of this difference in insertion forces is due to the needle size difference (17G and 18G) and the other part is due to the difference in tissue properties that are specific to the individual patient. Some transverse forces were observed, which are attributed to several factors such as tissue heterogeneity, organ movement, human factors in surgery, and the interaction between the template and the needle. However, theses insertion forces are significantly responsible for needle deviation from the desired trajectory and target movement. Therefore, a proper selection of needle and modulated velocity (translational and rotational) may reduce the tissue deformation and target movement by reducing insertion forces and thereby improve the seed delivery accuracy. The knowledge gleaned from this study promises to be useful for not only designing mechanical/robotic systems but also developing a predictive deformation model of the prostate and real-time adaptive controlling of the needle.},

  abstract       = {Robot-assisted surgery is of growing interest in the surgical and engineering communities. The use of robots allows surgery to be performed with precision using smaller instruments and incisions, resulting in shorter healing times. However, using current technology, an operator cannot directly feel the operation because the surgeon-instrument and instrument-tissue interaction force feedbacks are lost during needle insertion. Advancements in force feedback and control not only help reduce tissue deformation and needle deflection but also provide the surgeon with better control over the surgical instruments. The goal of this review is to summarize the key components surrounding the force feedback and control during robot-assisted needle insertion. The literature search was conducted during the middle months of 2017 using mainstream academic search engines with a combination of keywords relevant to the field. In total, 166 articles with valuable contents were analyzed and grouped into five related topics. This survey systemically summarizes the state-of-the-art force control technologies for robot-assisted needle insertion, such as force modeling, measurement, the factors that influence the interaction force, parameter identification, and force control algorithms. All studies show force control is still at its initial stage. The influence factors, needle deflection or planning remain open for investigation in future.},

  abstract = {Percutaneous needle insertion is amongst the most prevalent clinical procedures. The effectiveness of needle-base interventions heavily relies on needle targeting accuracy. However, the needle interacts with the surrounding tissue during insertion and deflects away from its intended trajectory. To overcome this problem, a significant research effort has been made towards developing robotic systems to automatically steer bevel-tipped needles percutaneously, which is a comprehensive and challenging control problem. A flexible needle inserted in soft tissue is an under-actuated system with nonholonomic constraints. Closed-loop feedback control of needle in tissue is challenging due to measurement errors, unmodelled dynamics created by tissue heterogeneity, and motion of targets within the tissue. In this paper, we review recent progress made in each of the complementary components that constitute a closed-loop needle steering system, including modelling needle-tissue interaction, sensing needle deflection, controlling needle trajectory, and hardware implementation.},

We propose that, by using nonholonomic kinematics, control, and path planning, an appropriately designed needle can be steered through tissue to reach a specified 3D target. Such steering capability could enhance targeting accuracy and may improve outcomes for percutaneous therapies, facilitate research on therapy effectiveness, and eventually enable new minimally invasive techniques. In this paper, we consider a first step toward active needle steering: design and experimental validation of a nonholonomic model for steering flexible needles with bevel tips. The model generalizes the standard three degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonholonomic unicycle and bicycle models to 6 DOF using Lie group theory. Model parameters are fit using experimental data, acquired via a robotic device designedfor the specific purpose of inserting and steering a flexible needle. The experiments quantitatively validate the bevel-tip needle steering model, enabling future research in flexible needle path planning, control, and simulation.},

It focuses on mechanical aspects and design choices in relation to the observed response in a tissue phantom. Tip steering with two rotational degrees of freedom was achieved by a tendon actuated ball joint mechanism. During insertion, the flexible cannula bends as a result of asymmetric tip–tissue interaction forces. The stylet was equipped with fiber Bragg gratings to measure the needle shape and tip position during use. A PI-controller was implemented to facilitate steering to predefined targets. During the validation study, nine targets were defined at a depth of 100 mm below the gelatin surface. One was located below the insertion point, the others at a radial offset of 30 mm in each of the eight principle steering directions. Per location, six repetitions were performed. The targeting accuracy was 6.2 ± 1.4 mm (mean ± std). The steering precision was 2.6 ± 1.1 mm. The ability to steer with this new needle steering approach is presented and the mechanical characteristics are discussed for this representative subset of steering directions.},

  abstract = {Steering of needles involves the planning and timely modifying of instrument-tissue force interactions to allow for controlled deflections during the insertion in tissue. In this work, the effect of tip shape on these forces was studied using 10 mm diameter needle tips. Six different tips were selected, including beveled and conical versions, with or without pre-bend or pre-curve. A six-degree-of-freedom force/torque sensor measured the loads during indentations in tissue simulants. The increased insertion (axial) and bending (radial) forces with insertion depth -- the force-displacement slopes -- were analyzed. Results showed that the ratio between radial and axial forces was not always proportional. This means that the tip load does not have a constant orientation, as is often assumed in mechanics-based steering models. For all tip types, the tip-load assumed a more radial orientation with increased axial load. This effect was larger for straight tips than for pre-bent or pre-curved tips. In addition, the force-displacement slopes were consistently higher for (1) increased tip angles, and for (2) beveled tips compared to conical tips. Needles with a bent or curved tip allow for an increased bending force and a decreased variability of the tip load vector orientation.},

  abstract = {Although the use of fine-gauge spinal needles reduces the incidence of postdural puncture headache, they are associated with increased risk of placement failure as a result of deflection and bending. This in vitro study quantifies spinal needle deflection from the axis of insertion with respect to needle type, gauge, and tip bend. In addition to straight-tip needles, those with standardized 5 degrees and 10 degrees tip bends were studied. The purpose was to examine the effect of tip bend, which has been described with small gauge spinal needles after bony contact, on needle path deflection. Needles studied included Quincke (Q), Sprotte (S), and Whitacre (W) in sizes ranging from 18-gauge to 29-gauge. Needles were inserted perpendicularly into porcine paraspinous muscle followed by radiologic investigation. Measurements of needle deflection from the axis of insertion at depths of 20, 40, and 60 mm were performed in a blinded fashion. Straight-tip Q needle deflection, but not W or S, was correlated with gauge and depth of insertion. Although there were differences within needle type groups, needle deflection was generally correlated with the degree of tip bend. We conclude that spinal needle deflection is dependent on the type of needle (W < S < Q), and that the magnitude of deflection is related to gauge (large < small) and tip bend (straight < 5 degrees < 10 degrees).

  abstract = {Surgical simulators present a safe and potentially effective method for surgical training, and can also be used in robot-assisted surgery for pre- and intra-operative planning. Accurate modeling of the interaction between surgical instruments and organs has been recognized as a key requirement in the development of high-fidelity surgical simulators. Researchers have attempted to model tool-tissue interactions in a wide variety of ways, which can be broadly classified as (1) linear elasticity-based, (2) nonlinear (hyperelastic) elasticity-based finite element (FE) methods, and (3) other techniques that not based on FE methods or continuum mechanics. Realistic modeling of organ deformation requires populating the model with real tissue data (which are difficult to acquire in vivo) and simulating organ response in real time (which is computationally expensive). Further, it is challenging to account for connective tissue supporting the organ, friction, and topological changes resulting from tool-tissue interactions during invasive surgical procedures. Overcoming such obstacles will not only help us to model tool-tissue interactions in real time, but also enable realistic force feedback to the user during surgical simulation. This review paper classifies the existing research on tool-tissue interactions for surgical simulators specifically based on the modeling techniques employed and the kind of surgical operation being simulated, in order to inform and motivate future research on improved tool-tissue interaction models.},

This system consists of a piezoelectrically actuated slave robot for needle placement with integrated fiber optic force sensor utilizing Fabry-Perot interferometry (FPI) sensing principle. The sensor flexure is optimized and embedded to the slave robot for measuring needle insertion force. A novel, compact opto-mechanical FPI sensor interface is integrated into an MRI robot control system. By leveraging the complementary features of pneumatic and piezoelectric actuation, a pneumatically actuated haptic master robot is also developed to render force associated with needle placement interventions to the clinician. An aluminum load cell is implemented and calibrated to close the impedance control loop of the master robot. A force-position control algorithm is developed to control the hybrid actuated system. Teleoperated needle insertion is demonstrated under live MR imaging, where the slave robot resides in the scanner bore and the user manipulates the master beside the patient outside the bore. Force and position tracking results of the master-slave robot are demonstrated to validate the tracking performance of the integrated system. It has a position tracking error of 0.318mm and sine wave force tracking error of 2.227N.},

  abstract = {Needle insertion is performed in many clinical and therapeutic procedures. Tissue displacement and needle bending which result from needle–tissue interaction make accurate targeting difficult. For performing physicians to gain essential needle targeting skills, needle insertion simulators can be used for training. An accurate needle bending model is essential for such simulators. These bending models are also needed for needle path planning. In this paper, three different models are presented to simulate the deformations of a needle. The first two models use the finite element method and take the geometric nonlinearity into account. The third model is a series of rigid bars connected by angular springs. The models were compared to recorded deformations during experiments of applying lateral tip forces on a brachytherapy needle. The model parameters were identified and the simulation results were compared to the experimental data. The results show that the angular spring model, which is computationally the most efficient model, is also the most accurate in modeling the bending of the brachytherapy needle.},

  abstract  = {We present algorithms for simulating and visualizing the insertion and steering of needles through deformable tissues for surgical training and planning. Needle insertion is an essential component of many clinical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The success of these procedures depends on accurate guidance of the needle tip to a clinical target while avoiding vital tissues. Needle insertion deforms body tissues, making accurate placement difficult. Our interactive needle insertion simulator models the coupling between a steerable needle and deformable tissue. We introduce (1) a novel algorithm for local remeshing that quickly enforces the conformity of a tetrahedral mesh to a curvilinear needle path, enabling accurate computation of contact forces, (2) an efficient method for coupling a 3D finite element simulation with a 1D inextensible rod with stick-slip friction, and (3) optimizations that reduce the computation time for physically based simulations. We can realistically and interactively simulate needle insertion into a prostate mesh of 13,375 tetrahedra and 2,763 vertices at a 25 Hz frame rate on an 8-core 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon PC. The simulation models prostate brachytherapy with needles of varying stiffness, steering needles around obstacles, and supports motion planning for robotic needle insertion. We evaluate the accuracy of the simulation by comparing against real-world experiments in which flexible, steerable needles were inserted into gel tissue phantoms.},

  abstract = {AbstractHigh precision in the manual control of needles and biopsy probes in medical treatment requires high skill and dexterity levels. In anaesthesia, force sensation is an important feedback mechanism, and the practitioner needs to refresh or develop skills to improve on the interpretation of needle progress towards the target site. This paper describes an experimental tactile force simulator for uniaxial needle action for which the force resisting progress of the needle is derived from measured data. As an example, the approach taken to develop the simulation of the insertion of epidural needles is described. Adaptation to other procedures would be possible by adopting new reference models based on appropriate measured force data.},

  abstract   = {The development of needles, needle–insertion simulators, and needle-wielding robots for use in a clinical environment depends on a thorough understanding of the mechanics of needle–tissue interaction. It stands to reason that the forces arising from this interaction are influenced by numerous factors, such as needle type, insertion speed, and tissue characteristics. However, exactly how these factors influence the force is not clear. For this reason, the influence of various factors on needle insertion-force was investigated by searching literature for experimental data. This resulted in a comprehensive overview of experimental insertion-force data available in the literature, grouped by factor for quick reference. In total, 99 papers presenting such force data were found, with typical peak forces in the order of 1–10N. The data suggest, for example, that higher velocity tends to decrease puncture force and increase friction. Furthermore, increased needle diameter was found to increase peak forces, and conical needles were found to create higher peak forces than beveled needles. However, many questions remain open for investigation, especially those concerning the influence of tissue characteristics.},

  abstract = {Characterising and modelling the mechanical behaviour of biological soft tissues is an essential step in the development of predictive computational models to assist research for a wide range of applications in medicine, biology, tissue engineering, pharmaceutics, consumer goods, cosmetics, transport or military. It is therefore critical to develop constitutive models that can capture particular rheological mechanisms operating at specific length scales so that these models are adapted for their intended applications. Here, a novel mesoscopically-based decoupled invariant-based continuum constitutive framework for transversely isotropic and orthotropic biological soft tissues is developed. A notable feature of the formulation is the full decoupling of shear interactions. The constitutive model is based on a combination of the framework proposed by Lu and Zhang [Lu, J., Zhang, L., 2005. Physically motivated invariant formulation for transversely isotropic hyperelasticity. International Journal of Solids and Structures 42, 6015–6031] and the entropic mechanics of tropocollagen molecules and collagen assemblies. One of the key aspects of the formulation is to use physically-based nanoscopic quantities that could be extracted from experiments and/or atomistic/molecular dynamics simulations to inform the macroscopic constitutive behaviour. This effectively couples the material properties at different levels of the multi-scale hierarchical structure of collagenous tissues. The orthotropic hyperelastic model was shown to reproduce very well the experimental multi-axial properties of rabbit skin. A new insight into the shear response of a skin sample subjected to a simulated indentation test was obtained using numerical direct sensitivity analyses.},

Robot technology can overcome those limitations and increase the success of minimally invasive percutaneous treatment.

It is obvious that the interaction is influenced by numerous variable parameters, which are divided into three categories: needle geometries, insertion methods, and tissue characteristics. A series of experiments are performed to explore the effect of influence factors (material samples n=5 for each factor) on the insertion force. Data were collected from different biological tissues and a special tissue-equivalent phantom with similar mechanical properties, using a 1-DOF mechanical testing system instrumented with a 6-DOF force/torque (F/T) sensor. The experimental results indicate that three basic phases (deformation, insertion, and extraction phase) are existent during needle penetration. Needle diameter (0.7–3.2mm), needle tip (blunt, diamond, conical, and beveled) and bevel angle (10–85°) are turned out to have a great influence on insertion force, so do the insertion velocity (0.5–10mm/s), drive mode (robot-assisted and hand-held), and the insertion process (interrupted and continuous). Different tissues such as skin, muscle, fat, liver capsule and vessel are proved to generate various force cures, which can contribute to the judgement of the needle position and provide efficient insertion strategy.},

The purpose was to elucidate a method of determining the dynamic friction coefficient and estimating the cutting force. The elastic force was obtained by pressing a test piece with a stick. The needle inserted twice to the test piece. The dynamic friction coefficient and the cutting force were calculated based on the elastic force and the second needle insertion force. The experimental and the theoretical cutting force wave forms were consistent qualitatively. The cutting force could estimate by obtaining the elastic force and the dynamic friction coefficient.},

The utility of haptic simulation systems in training clinicians for these procedures is highly dependent upon the ability to render accurate insertion force feedback. This paper presents a piecewise mathematical model for insertion force that does not require tissue material properties, detailed mechanical approximations, or complex computations. With manipulation of model parameters, a wide variety of insertion tasks and clinical scenarios can be modeled. Through needle insertion experiments and parameter estimation, this model was demonstrated to replicate the insertion forces associated with a variety of needle and tissue types. In 11 of 12 needle and tissue combinations tested, the model replicated the insertion force with an average absolute mean error of less than 0.065 N.},

Many researches have been done on force control to help surgeons during medical procedures, such as physiological motion compensation and tele-operation systems with haptic feedback. In order to increase the performance of such controllers, this work presents a novel force control scheme using Active Observer (AOB) based on a viscoelastic interaction model. The control scheme has shown to be stable through theoretical analysis and its performance was evaluated by in vitro experiments. In order to evaluate how the force control scheme behaves under the presence of physiological motion, experiments considering breathing and beating heart disturbances are presented. The proposed control scheme presented a stable behavior in both static and moving environment. The viscoelastic AOB presented a compensation ratio of 87% for the breathing motion and 79% for the beating heart motion.},

Two different constitutive models are considered. The first and simplest one is the Kelvin model, which does not consider instantaneous responses. The second, Boltzmann model, considers both instantaneous and viscous behaviour of materials. An appropriate kinematical relation together with differential viscoelastic constitutive representations are employed in order to built the proposed Scheme. Spatial approximations are applied for boundary elements before time solution. The proposed technique results in a time marching process that does not use relaxation (or creep) functions to recover viscous behaviour. Some examples are shown in order to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the technique when compared to analytical solutions.},

The present study aims to construct stochastic models of the force required to puncture a kidney using a trocar needle, based on measurements. To this end, a total of sixty insertions were performed into porcine kidneys (ex vivo), at constant speed, using a linear motion stage. Axial force was measured at the needle hub and an ultrasound probe moved with the needle to enable identification of anatomical structures. Two force peaks were observed for each tissue layer punctured, one caused by the tip and one by the edge of the cannula. Based on ultrasound data these double-peaks were classified into four groups, related to kidney capsule and internal structures. Group size varied from 7 to 55 double-peaks. Force peaks in each group were evaluated in terms of peak force and drop in force for both tip and cannula, and stochastic models were constructed that describe the multivariate distribution of these metrics. Peak forces in the capsule and internal structures ranged up to 2?N and 8?N, respectively. The resulting models can be used to simulate kidney puncture events in a variety of applications.},

  abstract = {Although `Needle steering` is considered a challenge in needle insertion strategies, needle control becomes a crucial training tool for evaluating surgeon`s skills in such critical incision. In this study, a model-based dynamics equation for the needle movement through the soft tissue is developed. In the proposed control scheme, the force estimation calculated through the simulated tissue deformation data and the dynamic finite element as the tissue model, is used as the force feedback. To point out the role of mechanical properties of the soft tissue, an inverse dynamics control method is used to demonstrate the system performance in presence of uncertainty in tissue mechanical parameters. Moreover, it is shown that the uncertainty in the tissue mechanical parameters dramatically affects the system performance as well as causing instability. Hence subsequently, a robust control approach is designed to compensate for the undesirable effect of parameter uncertainty in the system.},

A platform with two degrees of freedom was set up to study the effect of vibration frequency on needle insertion force. The gel phantom deformation at the needle cutting edge and the Voigt model are utilized to develop a dynamic model to explain the relationship between the insertion force and needle-tip velocity. The accuracy of this model was verified by performing needle insertions into phantom gel. The effect of vibration on insertion force can be explained as the vibration increasing the needle-tip velocity and subsequently increasing the insertion force. In a series of needle insertion experiments with different vibration frequencies, the peak forces were selected for comparison to explore the effect of vibration frequency on needle insertion force. The experimental results indicate that the insertion force at 500Hz increases up to 17.9% compared with the force at 50Hz.},

However, with current techniques, the procedures are challenging and a high level of expertise is required to perform them successfully. This paper presents a novel steerable needle device for percutaneous interventions that allows the physician to steer the tip of the needle during insertion which eases the challenge associated with reaching the target. The steering concept uses slightly modified, off-the-shelf medical biopsy needles. A controlled lateral steering motion of over 30 mm during a 100-mm needle insertion is demonstrated with a 20-gauge needle in tissue-mimicking phantoms. A hand-held, motorized device has been built that actuates the needle base to produce a desired steering direction and magnitude at the tip. Steering commands may be supplied either by user input or by computer control. For the latter case, a method of software path planning has been developed that automatically steers the needle to a target.},

In prostate brachytherapy, the success of the procedure depends on the accurate placement of needles in their pre-planned target location. In order to steer the needle towards a defined target, past research has used ultrasound-image-based needle localization for needle tip position feedback. Acquiring and processing of ultrasound images, however, significantly limits the control sampling rate. This work proposes a method for needle path prediction and control without the need for image feedback. The needle tip path obtained during insertion from a force-sensor-based deflection estimator is used to parameterize a kinematic bicycle model. The bicycle model is then used to predict the needle tip path and the ideal rotation depth for reaching a desired target. Experimental results show that the introduced method accurately predicts the needle tip path and the ideal rotation depth to guide the needle to a pre-defined target.},

The model adaptively adjusts the shape of the distributed load as the needle is inserted. Experiments are carried out into gelatin phantom and porcine tissue to validate the deflection estimate's performance.

They affect the accuracy of needle placement, which in turn affects the effectiveness of needle-based therapies and biopsies. Methods In this study, a needle is inserted using a robot with two degrees of freedom. The needle is modelled as a flexible beam with clamped support at one end, and its deflection is estimated using online force/moment measurements at the needle base. To compensate for the needle deflection, the needle is axially rotated through 180° . The needle deflection estimation data is used to find the insertion depths at which needle rotations are to be performed. Results A bevelled-tip needle was inserted into animal tissue. The needle deflection at the target was reduced by about 90\%. It was observed that minimization of needle deflection reduced tissue deformation. The proposed method reduced needle deflection more than when needle insertion was performed with constant rotation. Conclusions Estimating needle tip position using online force/moment measurement improves the accuracy of robot-assisted percutaneous procedures when imaging feedback is not available.

  abstract = {Planning and practice of surgical procedures can be improved through the use of modelling. This study provides an insight into the biopsy needle (i.e. hollow cannula) and needle-tissue interactions using a modelling approach, thus enabling the optimization of needle-tip designs not only for training but also for the planning of surgical procedures. Simulations of needle insertion into agar gel were performed using a Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) based finite element (FE) analysis, adapted for large deformation and tissue fracture. The experimental work covers needle insertion into 3% agar gel using a needle with a beveled tip of various angles, to assess the validity of the simulation. The simulated needle deflection and insertion force for two needles (i.e. Needle 1 with 18° bevel angle and Needle 2 with 27° bevel angle) were compared with corresponding experimental results. The contact stress (i.e. contact pressure) on the needles from the agar gel during the insertion of the needles were also studied. Observations indicate that varying the needle bevel angle from 27° to 18° results in a decrease of the peak force (i.e. puncture force) and an increase in needle deflection. Quantitatively, the percentage errors between the experimental data and the FE model for the total insertion force along the z-direction (i.e. Z Force) for Needle 1 and 2 were 4% and 4.8% (p > 0.05), respectively. Similarly, needle deflection percentage errors along the x-z plane were 5.7% and 10% respectively. Therefore, the forces and needle deflection values predicted by the simulation are a close approximation of the experimental model, validating the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian based FE model. Thus, providing an experimentally validated model for biopsy and cytology needle design in silico that has the potential to replace the current build and break approach of needle design used by manufacturers.},

  abstract = {In percutaneous interventions, reaching targets located deep inside the body with minimal tissue damage and patient pain requires the use of long and thin needles. However, when pushed through a solid substrate, a structure with a high aspect ratio is prone to buckle. We developed a series of multi-element needles with a diameter smaller than 1 mm and a length larger than 200 mm, and we experimentally evaluated the performance of a bio-inspired insertion mechanism that prevents needle buckling of such slender structures. The needles consisted of Nitinol wires and advance into a substrate by pushing the wires forward one after the other, followed by pulling all the wires simultaneously backward. The resulting net push force is low, allowing the needles to self-propel through the substrate. We investigated the effect of the needle design parameters (number of wires and their diameter) and substrate characteristics (stiffness and number of layers) on the needle motion. Three needle prototypes (consisting of six 0.25-mm wires, six 0.125-mm wires, and three 0.25-mm wires, respectively) were inserted into single- and multi-layered tissue-mimicking phantoms. The prototypes were able to move forward in all phantoms without buckling. The amount of needle slip with respect to the phantom was used to assess the performance of the prototypes. The six-wire 0.25-mm prototype exhibited the least slip among the three prototypes. Summarizing, we showed that a bio-inspired motion mechanism prevents buckling in very thin (diameter <1 mm), long (length >200 mm) needles, allowing deep insertion into tissue-mimicking phantoms.},

  abstract = {In prostate brachytherapy, radioactive seeds are implanted into the prostate for treatment of early-stage localized cancer. A major issue is seed displacement due to needle deflection, which is difficult to control as the needle is inserted manually. To address the problem and automate needle insertion, robotic systems, mathematical models for estimation and prediction and control algorithms have been developed. The method of choice for robotic steering of beveled-tip needles is predominantly intermittent axial needle rotation since this re-aligns the beveled tip and thus re-directs the needle. In this work, we present a method for needle steering to supplement axial needle rotation. A point force applied laterally to the needle near its point of insertion into tissue is used to displace the needle perpendicularly relative to its insertion axis. An advantage of this method is that the lateral force provides a continuous control input and thus continuous deflection control as opposed to axial needle rotation by 180 degrees in the 2D case of planar needle steering. Further, more control over deflection is possible as the lateral force provides direct shape change for the needle and improves the under-actuated nature of the needle. In order to predict and estimate needle deflection during insertion while applying both lateral force and axial rotation, a mechanics- and energy-based model for needle deflection is developed. Both single-layer and multi-layer tissue can be modeled if the tissue layer thickness is known. The accuracy of the model is validated experimentally. A comparison between the measured tip deflection and the model-based estimate shows only a small error. Moreover, control and sensitivity studies are carried out through insertion simulations using the model. The studies show the potentials and limitations for needle deflection reduction with various combinations of lateral force application and intermittent 180 degrees axial needle rotation.},

Tissue rupture may lead to needle bending and insertion error. Therefore, analysis of the mechanics of rupture events in transverse isotropic space is essential for the precise control of needle motion. We analyzed the needle stiffness force and the cutting force, both related to rupture events, which are caused by contact deformation and tissue cutting, respectively. A modified model based on a homogeneous elastic half-space contact force model was used to describe the variation in the stiffness force of the needle. An energy-based maximum stiffness force model was proposed to predict the surface rupture for a needle that is inserted at different orientations. A model for the cutting force was presented based on a solid mechanics theory of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite material to analyze the effect of the needle tip pose on the cutting force. Experiments on porcine muscle confirmed that the stiffness force and the cutting force were clearly influenced by the insertion orientation angle. The developed models could predict the stiffness force and the cutting force during needle insertion into the transverse isotropic tissue. This method provides a foundation for predicting needle deflection in the transverse isotropic space.},

The different types of friction models considered are: •friction models for transient sliding under dry, boundary and mixed lubrication conditions,•friction models for micro-displacements of engineering surfaces subjected to transient sliding,•friction models often used in the simulation and control of technical systems,•combined friction models that represent physical behaviors fairly well but are also suitable for use in simulating systems,•friction models that take into account the stochastic nature of interacting surface asperities.},

By uniting these results with those of the controls community, a set of models and tools for friction compensation is provided which will be of value to both research and application engineers. The successful design and analysis of friction compensators depends heavily upon the quality of the friction model used, and the suitability of the analysis technique employed. Consequently, this survey first describes models of machine friction, followed by a discussion of relevant analysis techniques and concludes with a survey of friction compensation methods reported in the literature.

The discussion is based on both theoretical modeling and on a practical position control problem that was substantially resolved in developing the methodologies.

There were about 70 cylindrical samples, with diameter 7 mm and varying height (4-11 mm). The combined compression and elongation test provide a unified framework for both compression and elongation for applications such as computer-aided surgical simulation. It enable the zero stress state of the experimental liver sample to be precisely determined. A new equation that combined both logarithmic and polynomial strain energy forms was proposed in modelling these experimental data. The assumption of incompressibility was justified from a preliminary Poisson's ratio for elongation and compression at 0.43{\textpm}0.16 and 0.47{\textpm}0.15, respectively. This equation provided a good fit for the observed mechanical properties of liver during compression-elongation cycles and for separate compressions or elongations. The root mean square errors were 91.92{\textpm}17.43 Pa, 57.55{\textpm}13.23 Pa and 29.78{\textpm}17.67 Pa, respectively. In comparison with existing strain energy functions, this combined model was the better constitutive equation. Application of this theoretical model to small liver samples and other tissues demonstrated its suitability as the material model of choice for soft tissue.},

The objective of our work is to develop and validate a viscoelastic and nonlinear physical liver model. First, an overview is given of the development of the physical liver model. Second, the experimental method to validate the model is explained. In-vitro experiments that made use of a pigpsilas liver were conducted for comparison with the simulation using the model. Results of the in-vitro experiment showed that the liver model reproduces (1) the relationship between needle displacement and force during needle insertion; (2) velocity dependence of needle displacement and force when a puncture occurs; and (3) nonlinear and viscoelastic response of displacement at an internally located point displacement, with high accuracy.},

A nonlinear Hunt-Crossley model, which is physically consistent with the real behavior of the system at contact, is used to represent the viscoelastic contact dynamics. A Neural Network feedforward term is used in the controller to estimate the environment uncertainties, which are not linear-in-parameters. The NN Lyapunov based controller is shown to guarantee uniformly ultimately bounded regulation of the system despite parametric and nonparametric uncertainties in the robot and the viscoelastic environment respectively. The proposed controller only depends on the position and velocity terms, and hence, obviates the need for measuring the impact force and acceleration. Further, the controller is continuous, and can be used for both non-contact and contact conditions.}},

To meet the requirement for the identification stage, a proven technique in nonlinear system identification will be adopted. This technique, called wavelet network, will provide a tool that is capable of identifying environments with significant nonlinear features. A theoretical development along with experimental results will be presented using a spring attached to a wall. This environment exhibits a linear region with a single nonlinearity. The wavelet network was chosen because it was designed specifically for use with problems of high input dimension. Therefore, it is the expectation that the procedure will be useful in identifying environments of varying complexity. Currently, the technique can be used to identify static nonlinear environments. Work is being done to extend its capabilities to handle dynamic environments.},

A pneumatics approach could use air jets, air pockets or inflatable bladders to provide touch feedback cues to the operator. Similarly the vibro-tactile approach could use vibrating pins, voice coils, or piezoelectric crystals to provide tickling sensation to the human operator's skin to signal the touch. The electro-tactile stimulation method can provide electric pulses of appropriate width and frequency to the skin, while the neuromuscular stimulation approach provides the signals directly to the primary cortex of the operator's brain. With regard to this, 17 devices, most of which were built for sensory substitution purposes, are examined and compared for their suitability as touch feedback devices for dexterous telemanipulation.<>},

There was relatively strong correlation between the axial force variation during insertion and the distribution of bone local CT-value along the needle path. This result shows the importance of preoperative X-ray CT image guidance for robotic needle insertion with safely small axial forces. There was no significant influence of FA-fixation on axial forces during robotic needle insertion to human femoral heads. The forces during robotic insertion to human femoral head were as small as less than 50{\%} of those during manual insertion, and which indicates that the robot can contribute to the safe needle insertion to human vertebra in percutaneous vertebroplasty.},

The purpose of the current research was to provide a new simulator for epidural insertion training. No reference data regarding the resistance force used when inserting a needle into patients have been reported. A comparative study was conducted to aid in the development of a new simulator. Pork loin (n=5) were employed as a substitute for patients. Thickness was set at 2 cm so as to improve the reproducibility. The authors took the conventional simulator apart, and picked a block as an analogue of muscle and ligamentum flavum. A new simulator was made of a melamine foam resin block and a latex rubber sheet. An epidural needle fixed on a motorized stage was inserted at the speed of 2 mm per second. The reaction force was measured while the needle was inserted into each specimen. Waveform of the pork loin exhibited two slopes of different inclines up to peaks and then falls after puncture. The conventional simulator showed a simple increase up to peak and a slow fall after puncture. In contrast, the new simulator showed two slopes up to peak and then a sudden fall after puncture. The insertion resistances were 2.5 N/s for the porcine, 0.8 N/s for the conventional and 2.1 N/s for the new simulator. The drop rates were 5 N/s for the porcine, 0.6 N/s for the conventional and 24 N/s for the new simulator. The higher insertion resistance and drop rate for the new simulator than the conventional simulator will be suitable for epidural insertion training.},

In this paper, we conducted an immersive needle insertion simulator for percutaneous surgery through visuo-haptic rendering. Multi-layered deformable tissue model with human anatomic textures are simulated and rendered. Mass-spring based force model and algorithm are also employed for realistic trocar needle insertion. Last but not least, a highly immersive virtual training scenario, integrated with a desktop haptic device is implemented to facilitate perceptive and hands-on experiences. Medical professional and trainees have also been invited to practice on the training scenario and provide subjective opinions in refining our implementation.},

In many of these procedures, the needle can be considered rigid and the tissue deforms and displaces substantially as the needle is advanced to its target. An energy based, fracture mechanics approach is presented to show that the velocity dependence of tissue properties can reduce tissue motion with increased needle velocities. In-vitro test results on porcine heart samples show that the force required to initiate cutting reduces with increasing needle velocity up to a critical speed, above which, the rate independent cutting force of the underlying tissue becomes the limiting factor. In-vivo tests show increased needle speed results in reduced force and displacement for needle insertion into the heart.

  abstract = {A literature review was conducted to develop more realistic medical simulators that better prepare aspiring health professionals to perform a medical procedure in vivo. Thus, this review proposes an approach that might assist researchers design improved medical simulators, particularly new materials that would enhance the sensation of touch for skin substitutes. By targeting the current needs in the field of simulation learning, we concluded that peripheral venous catheter insertion simulators lack realistic haptic feedback. Enhanced peripheral venous catheter insertion simulators will accelerate the mastery of the medical procedure, thus decreasing the number of failures in patients and costs related to this procedure.},

  abstract = {Although blood sampling is frequently performed, a system to take blood samples automatically has not yet been developed. In the paper, as a first step towards automatic blood sampling, an examination of an automatic method for puncturing blood vessels is described. The force waveforms produced by puncturing rabbit ear veins were measured. A characteristic peak, possibly associated with the needle piercing the vessel wall, was observed in each waveform of ten successful cases of 14 trials. An algorithm that allowed the detection of this peak was developed, and parameters of a filter to improve the accuracy of the algorithm were determined. Using this algorithm, automatic needle punctures were performed in a rabbit ear vein and then were simulated using the data derived from manual needle puncture on four other rabbits. The results gave 30 fully successful cases of 33 trials of needle puncture and showed that measurement of the puncture force may be important for automatic needle puncture of blood vessels.},
