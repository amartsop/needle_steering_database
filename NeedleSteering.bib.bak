  abstract      = {In this study, a distributed approach to account for dynamic friction during needle insertion in soft tissue is presented. As is well known, friction is a complex nonlinear phenomenon. It appears that classical or static models are unable to capture some of the observations made in systems subjected to significant frictional effects. In needle insertion, translational friction would be a matter of importance when the needle is very flexible, or a stop-and-rotate motion profile at low insertion velocities is implemented, and thus, the system is repeatedly transitioned from a pre-sliding to a sliding mode and vice versa. In order to characterize friction components, a distributed version of the LuGre model in the state-space representation is adopted. This method also facilitates estimating cutting force in an intra-operative manner. To evaluate the performance of the proposed family of friction models, experiments were conducted on homogeneous artificial phantoms and animal tissue. The results illustrate that our approach enables us to represent the main features of friction which is a major force component in needle-tissue interaction during needle-based interventions.},

The force at the fixed end of the needle and the needle deflection were measured using a force sensor and a bi-plane X-ray imaging system, and the model was evaluated with the data. We define a physical quantity w, which we can infinitesimal force per length, analogous to tranction (force per surface area). The model predicts w to be constant over the lenght of the i nserted portion of the needle. However the results indicate that this assumption does not fully accout for the real deflection. It is strongly suggested that there is an additional degree of freedom: a moment or a rotational force acting on the needle.},

  abstract = {The tip asymmetry of a bevel-tip needle results in the needle naturally bending when it is inserted into soft tissue. This enables robotic needle steering, which can be used in medical procedures to reach subsurface targets inaccessible by straight-line trajectories. However, accurate path planning and control of needle steering requires models of needle-tissue interaction. Previous kinematic models required empirical observations of each needle and tissue combination in order to fit model parameters. This study describes a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, which can be used to predict needle behavior and optimize system design based on fundamental mechanical and geometrical properties of the needle and tissue. We first present an analytical model for the loads developed at the tip, based on the geometry of the bevel edge and material properties of soft-tissue simulants (gels). We then present a mechanics-based model that calculates the deflection of a bevel-tipped needle inserted through a soft elastic medium. The model design is guided by microscopic observations of needle-gel interactions. The energy-based formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters, and the geometry and material properties of the needle. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in experimental studies of robotic needle insertion.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present needle insertion forces and motion trajectories measured during actual brachytherapy needle insertion while implanting radioactive seeds in the prostate glands of 20 different patients. The needle motion was captured using ultrasound images and a 6 degree-of-freedom electromagnetic-based position sensor. Needle velocity was computed from the position information and the corresponding time stamps. From in vivo data we found the maximum needle insertion forces to be about 15.6 and for and needles, respectively. Part of this difference in insertion forces is due to the needle size difference (17G and 18G) and the other part is due to the difference in tissue properties that are specific to the individual patient. Some transverse forces were observed, which are attributed to several factors such as tissue heterogeneity, organ movement, human factors in surgery, and the interaction between the template and the needle. However, theses insertion forces are significantly responsible for needle deviation from the desired trajectory and target movement. Therefore, a proper selection of needle and modulated velocity (translational and rotational) may reduce the tissue deformation and target movement by reducing insertion forces and thereby improve the seed delivery accuracy. The knowledge gleaned from this study promises to be useful for not only designing mechanical/robotic systems but also developing a predictive deformation model of the prostate and real-time adaptive controlling of the needle.},

  abstract       = {Robot-assisted surgery is of growing interest in the surgical and engineering communities. The use of robots allows surgery to be performed with precision using smaller instruments and incisions, resulting in shorter healing times. However, using current technology, an operator cannot directly feel the operation because the surgeon-instrument and instrument-tissue interaction force feedbacks are lost during needle insertion. Advancements in force feedback and control not only help reduce tissue deformation and needle deflection but also provide the surgeon with better control over the surgical instruments. The goal of this review is to summarize the key components surrounding the force feedback and control during robot-assisted needle insertion. The literature search was conducted during the middle months of 2017 using mainstream academic search engines with a combination of keywords relevant to the field. In total, 166 articles with valuable contents were analyzed and grouped into five related topics. This survey systemically summarizes the state-of-the-art force control technologies for robot-assisted needle insertion, such as force modeling, measurement, the factors that influence the interaction force, parameter identification, and force control algorithms. All studies show force control is still at its initial stage. The influence factors, needle deflection or planning remain open for investigation in future.},

  abstract = {Percutaneous needle insertion is amongst the most prevalent clinical procedures. The effectiveness of needle-base interventions heavily relies on needle targeting accuracy. However, the needle interacts with the surrounding tissue during insertion and deflects away from its intended trajectory. To overcome this problem, a significant research effort has been made towards developing robotic systems to automatically steer bevel-tipped needles percutaneously, which is a comprehensive and challenging control problem. A flexible needle inserted in soft tissue is an under-actuated system with nonholonomic constraints. Closed-loop feedback control of needle in tissue is challenging due to measurement errors, unmodelled dynamics created by tissue heterogeneity, and motion of targets within the tissue. In this paper, we review recent progress made in each of the complementary components that constitute a closed-loop needle steering system, including modelling needle-tissue interaction, sensing needle deflection, controlling needle trajectory, and hardware implementation.},

  abstract = { As a flexible needle with a bevel tip is pushed through soft tissue, the asymmetry of the tip causes the needle to bend. We propose that, by using nonholonomic kinematics, control, and path planning, an appropriately designed needle can be steered through tissue to reach a specified 3D target. Such steering capability could enhance targeting accuracy and may improve outcomes for percutaneous therapies, facilitate research on therapy effectiveness, and eventually enable new minimally invasive techniques. In this paper, we consider a first step toward active needle steering: design and experimental validation of a nonholonomic model for steering flexible needles with bevel tips. The model generalizes the standard three degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonholonomic unicycle and bicycle models to 6 DOF using Lie group theory. Model parameters are fit using experimental data, acquired via a robotic device designedfor the specific purpose of inserting and steering a flexible needle. The experiments quantitatively validate the bevel-tip needle steering model, enabling future research in flexible needle path planning, control, and simulation. },

It focuses on mechanical aspects and design choices in relation to the observed response in a tissue phantom. Tip steering with two rotational degrees of freedom was achieved by a tendon actuated ball joint mechanism. During insertion, the flexible cannula bends as a result of asymmetric tip–tissue interaction forces. The stylet was equipped with fiber Bragg gratings to measure the needle shape and tip position during use. A PI-controller was implemented to facilitate steering to predefined targets. During the validation study, nine targets were defined at a depth of 100 mm below the gelatin surface. One was located below the insertion point, the others at a radial offset of 30 mm in each of the eight principle steering directions. Per location, six repetitions were performed. The targeting accuracy was 6.2 ± 1.4 mm (mean ± std). The steering precision was 2.6 ± 1.1 mm. The ability to steer with this new needle steering approach is presented and the mechanical characteristics are discussed for this representative subset of steering directions.},

  abstract = {Steering of needles involves the planning and timely modifying of instrument-tissue force interactions to allow for controlled deflections during the insertion in tissue. In this work, the effect of tip shape on these forces was studied using 10 mm diameter needle tips. Six different tips were selected, including beveled and conical versions, with or without pre-bend or pre-curve. A six-degree-of-freedom force/torque sensor measured the loads during indentations in tissue simulants. The increased insertion (axial) and bending (radial) forces with insertion depth -- the force-displacement slopes -- were analyzed. Results showed that the ratio between radial and axial forces was not always proportional. This means that the tip load does not have a constant orientation, as is often assumed in mechanics-based steering models. For all tip types, the tip-load assumed a more radial orientation with increased axial load. This effect was larger for straight tips than for pre-bent or pre-curved tips. In addition, the force-displacement slopes were consistently higher for (1) increased tip angles, and for (2) beveled tips compared to conical tips. Needles with a bent or curved tip allow for an increased bending force and a decreased variability of the tip load vector orientation.},

  abstract = {Although the use of fine-gauge spinal needles reduces the incidence of postdural puncture headache, they are associated with increased risk of placement failure as a result of deflection and bending. This in vitro study quantifies spinal needle deflection from the axis of insertion with respect to needle type, gauge, and tip bend. In addition to straight-tip needles, those with standardized 5 degrees and 10 degrees tip bends were studied. The purpose was to examine the effect of tip bend, which has been described with small gauge spinal needles after bony contact, on needle path deflection. Needles studied included Quincke (Q), Sprotte (S), and Whitacre (W) in sizes ranging from 18-gauge to 29-gauge. Needles were inserted perpendicularly into porcine paraspinous muscle followed by radiologic investigation. Measurements of needle deflection from the axis of insertion at depths of 20, 40, and 60 mm were performed in a blinded fashion. Straight-tip Q needle deflection, but not W or S, was correlated with gauge and depth of insertion. Although there were differences within needle type groups, needle deflection was generally correlated with the degree of tip bend. We conclude that spinal needle deflection is dependent on the type of needle (W < S < Q), and that the magnitude of deflection is related to gauge (large < small) and tip bend (straight < 5 degrees < 10 degrees).

  abstract = {Surgical simulators present a safe and potentially effective method for surgical training, and can also be used in robot-assisted surgery for pre- and intra-operative planning. Accurate modeling of the interaction between surgical instruments and organs has been recognized as a key requirement in the development of high-fidelity surgical simulators. Researchers have attempted to model tool-tissue interactions in a wide variety of ways, which can be broadly classified as (1) linear elasticity-based, (2) nonlinear (hyperelastic) elasticity-based finite element (FE) methods, and (3) other techniques that not based on FE methods or continuum mechanics. Realistic modeling of organ deformation requires populating the model with real tissue data (which are difficult to acquire in vivo) and simulating organ response in real time (which is computationally expensive). Further, it is challenging to account for connective tissue supporting the organ, friction, and topological changes resulting from tool-tissue interactions during invasive surgical procedures. Overcoming such obstacles will not only help us to model tool-tissue interactions in real time, but also enable realistic force feedback to the user during surgical simulation. This review paper classifies the existing research on tool-tissue interactions for surgical simulators specifically based on the modeling techniques employed and the kind of surgical operation being simulated, in order to inform and motivate future research on improved tool-tissue interaction models.},

This system consists of a piezoelectrically actuated slave robot for needle placement with integrated fiber optic force sensor utilizing Fabry-Perot interferometry (FPI) sensing principle. The sensor flexure is optimized and embedded to the slave robot for measuring needle insertion force. A novel, compact opto-mechanical FPI sensor interface is integrated into an MRI robot control system. By leveraging the complementary features of pneumatic and piezoelectric actuation, a pneumatically actuated haptic master robot is also developed to render force associated with needle placement interventions to the clinician. An aluminum load cell is implemented and calibrated to close the impedance control loop of the master robot. A force-position control algorithm is developed to control the hybrid actuated system. Teleoperated needle insertion is demonstrated under live MR imaging, where the slave robot resides in the scanner bore and the user manipulates the master beside the patient outside the bore. Force and position tracking results of the master-slave robot are demonstrated to validate the tracking performance of the integrated system. It has a position tracking error of 0.318mm and sine wave force tracking error of 2.227N.},

  abstract = {Needle insertion is performed in many clinical and therapeutic procedures. Tissue displacement and needle bending which result from needle–tissue interaction make accurate targeting difficult. For performing physicians to gain essential needle targeting skills, needle insertion simulators can be used for training. An accurate needle bending model is essential for such simulators. These bending models are also needed for needle path planning. In this paper, three different models are presented to simulate the deformations of a needle. The first two models use the finite element method and take the geometric nonlinearity into account. The third model is a series of rigid bars connected by angular springs. The models were compared to recorded deformations during experiments of applying lateral tip forces on a brachytherapy needle. The model parameters were identified and the simulation results were compared to the experimental data. The results show that the angular spring model, which is computationally the most efficient model, is also the most accurate in modeling the bending of the brachytherapy needle.},

  abstract  = {We present algorithms for simulating and visualizing the insertion and steering of needles through deformable tissues for surgical training and planning. Needle insertion is an essential component of many clinical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The success of these procedures depends on accurate guidance of the needle tip to a clinical target while avoiding vital tissues. Needle insertion deforms body tissues, making accurate placement difficult. Our interactive needle insertion simulator models the coupling between a steerable needle and deformable tissue. We introduce (1) a novel algorithm for local remeshing that quickly enforces the conformity of a tetrahedral mesh to a curvilinear needle path, enabling accurate computation of contact forces, (2) an efficient method for coupling a 3D finite element simulation with a 1D inextensible rod with stick-slip friction, and (3) optimizations that reduce the computation time for physically based simulations. We can realistically and interactively simulate needle insertion into a prostate mesh of 13,375 tetrahedra and 2,763 vertices at a 25 Hz frame rate on an 8-core 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon PC. The simulation models prostate brachytherapy with needles of varying stiffness, steering needles around obstacles, and supports motion planning for robotic needle insertion. We evaluate the accuracy of the simulation by comparing against real-world experiments in which flexible, steerable needles were inserted into gel tissue phantoms.},

  abstract = { AbstractHigh precision in the manual control of needles and biopsy probes in medical treatment requires high skill and dexterity levels. In anaesthesia, force sensation is an important feedback mechanism, and the practitioner needs to refresh or develop skills to improve on the interpretation of needle progress towards the target site. This paper describes an experimental tactile force simulator for uniaxial needle action for which the force resisting progress of the needle is derived from measured data. As an example, the approach taken to develop the simulation of the insertion of epidural needles is described. Adaptation to other procedures would be possible by adopting new reference models based on appropriate measured force data. },

  abstract = {The development of needles, needle–insertion simulators, and needle-wielding robots for use in a clinical environment depends on a thorough understanding of the mechanics of needle–tissue interaction. It stands to reason that the forces arising from this interaction are influenced by numerous factors, such as needle type, insertion speed, and tissue characteristics. However, exactly how these factors influence the force is not clear. For this reason, the influence of various factors on needle insertion-force was investigated by searching literature for experimental data. This resulted in a comprehensive overview of experimental insertion-force data available in the literature, grouped by factor for quick reference. In total, 99 papers presenting such force data were found, with typical peak forces in the order of 1–10N. The data suggest, for example, that higher velocity tends to decrease puncture force and increase friction. Furthermore, increased needle diameter was found to increase peak forces, and conical needles were found to create higher peak forces than beveled needles. However, many questions remain open for investigation, especially those concerning the influence of tissue characteristics.},

  abstract = {Characterising and modelling the mechanical behaviour of biological soft tissues is an essential step in the development of predictive computational models to assist research for a wide range of applications in medicine, biology, tissue engineering, pharmaceutics, consumer goods, cosmetics, transport or military. It is therefore critical to develop constitutive models that can capture particular rheological mechanisms operating at specific length scales so that these models are adapted for their intended applications. Here, a novel mesoscopically-based decoupled invariant-based continuum constitutive framework for transversely isotropic and orthotropic biological soft tissues is developed. A notable feature of the formulation is the full decoupling of shear interactions. The constitutive model is based on a combination of the framework proposed by Lu and Zhang [Lu, J., Zhang, L., 2005. Physically motivated invariant formulation for transversely isotropic hyperelasticity. International Journal of Solids and Structures 42, 6015–6031] and the entropic mechanics of tropocollagen molecules and collagen assemblies. One of the key aspects of the formulation is to use physically-based nanoscopic quantities that could be extracted from experiments and/or atomistic/molecular dynamics simulations to inform the macroscopic constitutive behaviour. This effectively couples the material properties at different levels of the multi-scale hierarchical structure of collagenous tissues. The orthotropic hyperelastic model was shown to reproduce very well the experimental multi-axial properties of rabbit skin. A new insight into the shear response of a skin sample subjected to a simulated indentation test was obtained using numerical direct sensitivity analyses.},

  abstract = {A thorough understanding of needle–tissue interaction mechanics is necessary to optimize needle design, achieve robotically needle steering, and establish surgical simulation system. It is obvious that the interaction is influenced by numerous variable parameters, which are divided into three categories: needle geometries, insertion methods, and tissue characteristics. A series of experiments are performed to explore the effect of influence factors (material samples n=5 for each factor) on the insertion force. Data were collected from different biological tissues and a special tissue-equivalent phantom with similar mechanical properties, using a 1-DOF mechanical testing system instrumented with a 6-DOF force/torque (F/T) sensor. The experimental results indicate that three basic phases (deformation, insertion, and extraction phase) are existent during needle penetration. Needle diameter (0.7–3.2mm), needle tip (blunt, diamond, conical, and beveled) and bevel angle (10–85°) are turned out to have a great influence on insertion force, so do the insertion velocity (0.5–10mm/s), drive mode (robot-assisted and hand-held), and the insertion process (interrupted and continuous). Different tissues such as skin, muscle, fat, liver capsule and vessel are proved to generate various force cures, which can contribute to the judgement of the needle position and provide efficient insertion strategy.},

The purpose was to elucidate a method of determining the dynamic friction coefficient and estimating the cutting force. The elastic force was obtained by pressing a test piece with a stick. The needle inserted twice to the test piece. The dynamic friction coefficient and the cutting force were calculated based on the elastic force and the second needle insertion force. The experimental and the theoretical cutting force wave forms were consistent qualitatively. The cutting force could estimate by obtaining the elastic force and the dynamic friction coefficient.},

The utility of haptic simulation systems in training clinicians for these procedures is highly dependent upon the ability to render accurate insertion force feedback. This paper presents a piecewise mathematical model for insertion force that does not require tissue material properties, detailed mechanical approximations, or complex computations. With manipulation of model parameters, a wide variety of insertion tasks and clinical scenarios can be modeled. Through needle insertion experiments and parameter estimation, this model was demonstrated to replicate the insertion forces associated with a variety of needle and tissue types. In 11 of 12 needle and tissue combinations tested, the model replicated the insertion force with an average absolute mean error of less than 0.065 N.},

Many researches have been done on force control to help surgeons during medical procedures, such as physiological motion compensation and tele-operation systems with haptic feedback. In order to increase the performance of such controllers, this work presents a novel force control scheme using Active Observer (AOB) based on a viscoelastic interaction model. The control scheme has shown to be stable through theoretical analysis and its performance was evaluated by in vitro experiments. In order to evaluate how the force control scheme behaves under the presence of physiological motion, experiments considering breathing and beating heart disturbances are presented. The proposed control scheme presented a stable behavior in both static and moving environment. The viscoelastic AOB presented a compensation ratio of 87% for the breathing motion and 79% for the beating heart motion.},

Two different constitutive models are considered. The first and simplest one is the Kelvin model, which does not consider instantaneous responses. The second, Boltzmann model, considers both instantaneous and viscous behaviour of materials. An appropriate kinematical relation together with differential viscoelastic constitutive representations are employed in order to built the proposed Scheme. Spatial approximations are applied for boundary elements before time solution. The proposed technique results in a time marching process that does not use relaxation (or creep) functions to recover viscous behaviour. Some examples are shown in order to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the technique when compared to analytical solutions.},

  abstract = {The development of needle insertion robots and training simulators requires knowledge of the forces that arise when a needle is inserted into soft-tissue. The present study aims to construct stochastic models of the force required to puncture a kidney using a trocar needle, based on measurements. To this end, a total of sixty insertions were performed into porcine kidneys (ex vivo), at constant speed, using a linear motion stage. Axial force was measured at the needle hub and an ultrasound probe moved with the needle to enable identification of anatomical structures. Two force peaks were observed for each tissue layer punctured, one caused by the tip and one by the edge of the cannula. Based on ultrasound data these double-peaks were classified into four groups, related to kidney capsule and internal structures. Group size varied from 7 to 55 double-peaks. Force peaks in each group were evaluated in terms of peak force and drop in force for both tip and cannula, and stochastic models were constructed that describe the multivariate distribution of these metrics. Peak forces in the capsule and internal structures ranged up to 2?N and 8?N, respectively. The resulting models can be used to simulate kidney puncture events in a variety of applications.},

  abstract = {Although `Needle steering` is considered a challenge in needle insertion strategies, needle control becomes a crucial training tool for evaluating surgeon`s skills in such critical incision. In this study, a model-based dynamics equation for the needle movement through the soft tissue is developed. In the proposed control scheme, the force estimation calculated through the simulated tissue deformation data and the dynamic finite element as the tissue model, is used as the force feedback. To point out the role of mechanical properties of the soft tissue, an inverse dynamics control method is used to demonstrate the system performance in presence of uncertainty in tissue mechanical parameters. Moreover, it is shown that the uncertainty in the tissue mechanical parameters dramatically affects the system performance as well as causing instability. Hence subsequently, a robust control approach is designed to compensate for the undesirable effect of parameter uncertainty in the system.},

  abstract = {Needle insertion is critical in many clinical medicine procedures, such as biopsy, brachytherapy, and injection therapy. A platform with two degrees of freedom was set up to study the effect of vibration frequency on needle insertion force. The gel phantom deformation at the needle cutting edge and the Voigt model are utilized to develop a dynamic model to explain the relationship between the insertion force and needle-tip velocity. The accuracy of this model was verified by performing needle insertions into phantom gel. The effect of vibration on insertion force can be explained as the vibration increasing the needle-tip velocity and subsequently increasing the insertion force. In a series of needle insertion experiments with different vibration frequencies, the peak forces were selected for comparison to explore the effect of vibration frequency on needle insertion force. The experimental results indicate that the insertion force at 500Hz increases up to 17.9% compared with the force at 50Hz.},

  abstract = {Minimally invasive percutaneous medical procedures are widely accepted in current clinical practice. However, with current techniques, the procedures are challenging and a high level of expertise is required to perform them successfully. This paper presents a novel steerable needle device for percutaneous interventions that allows the physician to steer the tip of the needle during insertion which eases the challenge associated with reaching the target. The steering concept uses slightly modified, off-the-shelf medical biopsy needles. A controlled lateral steering motion of over 30 mm during a 100-mm needle insertion is demonstrated with a 20-gauge needle in tissue-mimicking phantoms. A hand-held, motorized device has been built that actuates the needle base to produce a desired steering direction and magnitude at the tip. Steering commands may be supplied either by user input or by computer control. For the latter case, a method of software path planning has been developed that automatically steers the needle to a target.},

Data was collected on bovine livers using the Johns Hopkins University Steady Hand Robot, and modeled in three parts: force due to capsule stiffness, friction, and cutting. Capsule stiffness is modeled by a nonlinear spring model, friction by a modified Karnopp model, and cutting by the remaining forces, which appear to be constant for a given tissue sample. During robot-assisted procedures, real-time force data can be compared to these models to control puncture of interior structures.},
